CREATE AND RUN THE SERVER:
    > Creation of the BackEnd server for the Project.
    > Last section we had completed the header part of the project in this part we are going to work with the Server side.

    > For that we need to create an api folder and in root of the folder we need to create a package.json file. Should be done on the root as we are using render platform for the deployment and it will check the root of the files.

    > To make the package.json use : npm init -y
    > As we have index.js file inside the package.json we need to make the file inside the api.

    > Install Express as the first step
    > Used for easily making backend and apis.
    >once installed import the express
    > Using express we can make the application
    > const app = express();
        app.listen(3000,()=>{
            console.log(`Server is Running on port 3000`);
        });
    > To run the server use the following: 
        node api/index.js
    > Till now we have no issues but when we are updating the server we cant see that updation in the server. Here we need to start the server ourselves.
    > So we uses :  npm i nodemon
    > But How can we use this:
    > After installing the nodemon using npm i nodemon
    > Go to the root package.json and change few items . 
    >"scripts": {
    "dev":"nodemon api/index.js",
    "start":"node api/index.js"
  }

  > Then Run the npm run dev
