Since we are having our username and password in the link that is being provided in the mongoose.connect so we need to have a secure connection such that our datas shouldnt be lost by the hacker so the following steps are used for such operations : 

> Create a file named .env
> Steps are we are creating the .env file and we give a name MONGO and the link is stored inside the MONGO 
>This is called inside the index.js as mongose.connect(process.env.MONGO)
>Since we are using this we ignore this while uploading the file to the github.

>We will be facing error in the nodemon so we need to install the dotenv file and import that in the index.js file and we can check whether the server is connected using then()
